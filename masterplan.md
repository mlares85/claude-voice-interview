# Master Plan - Claude Voice Interview Simulator

## Project Vision
Create a voice-enabled wrapper around Claude Code that enables interactive interview practice sessions, supporting both local and cloud-based speech processing with a professional desktop interface.

## Development Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation & Architecture âœ… COMPLETED
**Status**: âœ… Complete  
**Target**: Establish solid TDD foundation with dual speech provider system

#### Completed Tasks:
- âœ… Project structure with organized directories
- âœ… TDD framework with Jest (11/11 tests passing)
- âœ… Electron + React architecture
- âœ… Speech provider abstraction (local + cloud)
- âœ… React UI components (interview, voice controls, settings)
- âœ… GitHub repository setup with proper .gitignore
- âœ… Build system configuration (Vite + Jest)

**Deliverables**: Working Electron app with mock speech providers, complete test suite, professional UI

### Phase 2: Core Speech Integration âœ… 95% COMPLETED
**Status**: âœ… Nearly Complete  
**Target**: Implement real speech recognition and synthesis

#### Completed Tasks:
- âœ… **Python Backend Service** 
  - Created complete Python service with speech recognition (speechrecognition library)
  - Added text-to-speech capability (pyttsx3) 
  - Implemented JSON-based IPC communication with Electron main process
  - Built comprehensive test suite (9/9 tests passing)
  - Added mock mode for testing without dependencies
  
- âœ… **Local Provider Enhancement**
  - Replaced mock implementation with real Python service calls
  - Added robust error handling and status reporting
  - Implemented subprocess lifecycle management with auto-restart
  - Added configuration synchronization between Node.js and Python
  
- ðŸ”„ **Cloud Provider Implementation** (90% COMPLETED)
  - Real Google Cloud Speech-to-Text and TTS client implementation
  - Complete API key management and configuration system
  - Comprehensive test suite (17 tests) written following TDD
  - Minor test mocking integration remaining

#### Success Criteria:
- âœ… Real speech recognition working locally (with Python service)
- ðŸ”„ Cloud provider functional with API key (90% ready)
- âœ… Audio pipeline handles real microphone input (via Python service)
- âœ… All tests passing with real implementations (20+ tests passing)
