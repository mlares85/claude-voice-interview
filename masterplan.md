# Master Plan - Claude Voice Interview Simulator

## Project Vision
Create a voice-enabled wrapper around Claude Code that enables interactive interview practice sessions, supporting both local and cloud-based speech processing with a professional desktop interface.

## Development Phases

### Phase 1: Foundation & Architecture âœ… COMPLETED
**Status**: âœ… Complete  
**Target**: Establish solid TDD foundation with dual speech provider system

#### Completed Tasks:
- âœ… Project structure with organized directories
- âœ… TDD framework with Jest (11/11 tests passing)
- âœ… Electron + React architecture
- âœ… Speech provider abstraction (local + cloud)
- âœ… React UI components (interview, voice controls, settings)
- âœ… GitHub repository setup with proper .gitignore
- âœ… Build system configuration (Vite + Jest)

**Deliverables**: Working Electron app with mock speech providers, complete test suite, professional UI

### Phase 2: Core Speech Integration ðŸ”„ IN PROGRESS
**Status**: ðŸ”„ Next Priority  
**Target**: Implement real speech recognition and synthesis

#### Tasks:
- ðŸ”„ **Python Backend Service** (HIGH PRIORITY)
  - Create Python service with speech recognition (speechrecognition library)
  - Add text-to-speech capability (pyttsx3)
  - Implement IPC communication with Electron main process
  - Write comprehensive tests for Python service
  
- ðŸ”„ **Local Provider Enhancement**
  - Replace mock implementation with real Python service calls
  - Add proper error handling and status reporting
  - Implement audio format conversion and buffering
  
- ðŸ”„ **Cloud Provider Implementation** 
  - Integrate Google Cloud Speech-to-Text API
  - Add API key management and validation
  - Implement streaming recognition for better UX

#### Success Criteria:
- Real speech recognition working locally
- Cloud provider functional with API key
- Audio pipeline handles real microphone input
- All tests passing with real implementations
