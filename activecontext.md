# Active Context - Claude Voice Interview Simulator

## Current Session Summary
**Date**: 2025-09-10  
**Status**: Phase 2 Core Speech Integration nearly complete, ready for Phase 3 Claude Code integration

## What Was Accomplished This Session

### ‚úÖ Project Foundation (COMPLETED)
- **TDD Setup**: Created comprehensive test suite with 20+ tests passing
- **Architecture**: Implemented Electron + React with dual speech provider system
- **Speech Providers**: Built abstraction layer supporting local (Python) and cloud (Google) processing
- **UI Components**: Created complete React interface with interview panel, voice controls, and settings
- **Build System**: Configured Vite + Jest with proper linting and formatting
- **Version Control**: Set up GitHub repository with proper .gitignore and initial commit

### ‚úÖ Phase 2: Core Speech Integration (95% COMPLETED)
- **Python Backend Service**: Complete implementation with speech recognition & TTS
- **Local Provider Integration**: Real Python service communication via IPC
- **Mock Mode Support**: Works without dependencies for testing/CI environments
- **Comprehensive Testing**: 9/9 Python script tests + integration test suite
- **Error Handling**: Robust subprocess management with auto-restart capabilities
- **Configuration Sync**: Dynamic config updates between Node.js and Python

### üèóÔ∏è Current Architecture Status
```
‚úÖ Speech Provider Interface (100% tested)
‚úÖ Electron Main Process (IPC handlers ready)
‚úÖ React Frontend (UI components complete)
‚úÖ Python Backend Service (fully implemented with mock/real modes)
‚úÖ Local Speech Provider (integrated with Python service)
üîÑ Cloud Provider (Google Speech API - basic structure ready)
üîÑ Claude Code Integration (not yet implemented)
üîÑ End-to-End Audio Pipeline (components ready, needs integration testing)
```

### üîÑ Current Work in Progress
- **Google Cloud Speech API Integration**: Real implementation in progress
- **Tests Written First**: 17 comprehensive tests for Google Cloud provider (following TDD)
- **Implementation**: Real Google Cloud Speech-to-Text and TTS clients implemented
- **Status**: Debugging test mocks vs real client integration

## Immediate Next Steps
1. **Priority 1**: Complete Google Cloud Speech API test integration (90% done)
2. **Priority 2**: Create end-to-end integration tests
3. **Priority 3**: Begin Claude Code subprocess integration
4. **Priority 4**: Implement dynamic interview question generation

## Current Blockers
- Google Cloud test mocking needs refinement (technical, not architectural)

## Technical Decisions Made
- **Architecture**: Hybrid Electron + Python for best of both worlds
- **Testing**: Strict TDD approach with 90%+ coverage requirement
- **Speech**: Dual provider system (local privacy vs cloud accuracy)
- **Framework**: React for UI, Node.js for Electron main process

## Files Ready for Next Development Phase
- All foundation files committed to GitHub
- Test suite established and passing
- Development environment fully configured

## Notes for Next Session
- Follow TDD: Write tests first for Python service integration
- Maintain the established architecture patterns
- Keep speech provider abstraction clean for easy switching
