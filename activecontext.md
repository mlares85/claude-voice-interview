# Active Context - Claude Voice Interview Simulator

## Current Session Summary
**Date**: 2025-09-10  
**Status**: Initial project setup completed, ready for core feature development

## What Was Accomplished This Session

### ‚úÖ Project Foundation (COMPLETED)
- **TDD Setup**: Created comprehensive test suite with 11/11 tests passing
- **Architecture**: Implemented Electron + React with dual speech provider system
- **Speech Providers**: Built abstraction layer supporting local (Python) and cloud (Google) processing
- **UI Components**: Created complete React interface with interview panel, voice controls, and settings
- **Build System**: Configured Vite + Jest with proper linting and formatting
- **Version Control**: Set up GitHub repository with proper .gitignore and initial commit

### üèóÔ∏è Current Architecture Status
```
‚úÖ Speech Provider Interface (100% tested)
‚úÖ Electron Main Process (IPC handlers ready)
‚úÖ React Frontend (UI components complete)
üîÑ Python Backend Service (mock implementation only)
üîÑ Claude Code Integration (not yet implemented)
üîÑ Real Audio Processing (browser MediaRecorder only)
```

## Immediate Next Steps
1. **Priority 1**: Implement Python backend service for local speech recognition
2. **Priority 2**: Add Claude Code subprocess integration
3. **Priority 3**: Enhance audio pipeline with real-time processing
4. **Priority 4**: Add session management and recording features

## Current Blockers
- None identified

## Technical Decisions Made
- **Architecture**: Hybrid Electron + Python for best of both worlds
- **Testing**: Strict TDD approach with 90%+ coverage requirement
- **Speech**: Dual provider system (local privacy vs cloud accuracy)
- **Framework**: React for UI, Node.js for Electron main process

## Files Ready for Next Development Phase
- All foundation files committed to GitHub
- Test suite established and passing
- Development environment fully configured

## Notes for Next Session
- Follow TDD: Write tests first for Python service integration
- Maintain the established architecture patterns
- Keep speech provider abstraction clean for easy switching
